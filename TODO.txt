 * Update simple expression1.tpg comments to match last features
 * Write documentation
 * Review C++ generated code and improve it (more use of templates ???)
 * Find a way for the ParseTree to return the correct type
 * Remove Non terminal default return value (it will be useless once the ParseTree will be able to return the correct type)
 * Generate Token and TokenType in separate files in Java
 * Add string in addition to regex as TerminalSymbols for performances
 * Make C++, C# and VB searching for terminal token at the beginning of the parsed string only (Java lookingAt equivalent)
 * Fix management of verbatim (@"xxx") and regular ("") strings (for now, both behave the same, ie, verbatim)
 
Prospecting/Long Term:
 * Make Error Codes consistant
 * Add my backtracking parser as a possible implementation (in addition to LL(1))
 * Add a Search (and SearchXXX) method (in addition to Parse (and ParseXXX)) in the Parser
 * Add python and javascript generation
 * Port the code to Visual Source Code
 * Remove VB support
